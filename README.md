## Galicia Marine Resources

The activity of exploitation of marine resources of Galicia has a number of references on the Internet, provided by the different actors involved in this economic activity, mainly public administrations that have jurisdiction over it.

These references ranging from the annual activity planning of resource exploitation, through the coastal descricion production and detailed statistics of the first sale of fishery products.

In 1992 a management system for the next coastal resources based on an annual plan, mainly shellfish is adopted. This model allows flexibility in use that allows to adapt to market needs and the integration of new species and modes of taking on the system.

The system's flexibility makes it match several management plans in a particular area based on the ownership of the territory, of the exploited species and the various settlements of a biological population have different management rules.

The advantage is that we have sources of information to measure this variability.

The objective of this project is the search for these sources of information, evaluation and presentation of the information contained in formats that can be addressed by researchers interested in this resource and that takes advantage of society.

There are sources that the information they contain can be treated directly as presented, this source is only outlined.

The result is a database that allows access to existing information on marine resources of Galicia
